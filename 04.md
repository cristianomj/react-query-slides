# React is a state management library

> The state management library you don't have to `yarn add` or `npm install`

For example:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>
}

function App() {
  return <Counter />
}
```

# Sharing state across components

Lift State Up

# The Prop Drilling "problem"

## Use composition

Instead of making components that render other components and wiring props
everywhere, we could compose things together:

```jsx
function App() {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = React.useState('some state')
  return (
    <>
      <Header
        logo={<Logo someState={someState} />}
        settings={<Settings onStateChange={setSomeState} />}
      />
      <LeftNav>
        <SomeLink someState={someState} />
        <SomeOtherLink someState={someState} />
        <Etc someState={someState} />
      </LeftNav>
      {/* ... */}
    </>
  )
}
```

## Use context

Sometimes composition doesn't go far enough for us. For that, we can use context
